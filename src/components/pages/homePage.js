				<p>Up and coming web developer with a passion for learning with an endless supply of optimism and curiosity.</p>
				<p>One of my stronger points is writing front-ends that are smooth, simple and aesthetically pleasing. I primary use languages and libraries such as Javascript, CSS and Sass but I'm always learning new ones to try to find more efficient ways of doing things.</p>
				<p>I am also growing increasingly comfortable and familiar with back-end development using Node.js, MySQL, Sequelize, etc.</p>
				<p>I'm based in LA right now but I love traveling and going to new places so I am open to relocating if need be.</p>
