				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Web developer with a passion for learning with an endless supply of optimism and curiosity.</p>

				<p>One of my stronger points is writing front-ends that are smooth, simple and aesthetically pleasing. I primarily use languages and libraries such as Javascript, CSS, Sass and React. I'm also constantly learning new ones to try to find more efficient ways of doing things.</p>

				<p>I am also growing increasingly comfortable and familiar with back-end development using Node.js, MySQL, Sequelize, Mongodb, etc.
				</p>

				<p>Music is a big passion of mine. I took guitar and piano lessons growing up and still play every day. I have experience working at a world-class recording studio in Hollywood, where I was testing the waters in potentially pursuing a career in sound engineering. I would love to have the opportunity to work as a developer with a company that makes music production and recording software or is involved in the music industry in some capacity.
				</p>

				<p>I'm based in LA right now but I love traveling and going to new places so I am open to relocating if need be.
